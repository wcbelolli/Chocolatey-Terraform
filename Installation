# This message will display but it means it was installed already ;)
WARNING: 'choco' was found at 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\choco.exe'.
WARNING: An existing Chocolatey installation was detected. Installation will not continue. This script will not overwrite existing installations.
If there is no Chocolatey installation at 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey', delete the folder and attempt the installation again.

Please use choco upgrade chocolatey to handle upgrades of Chocolatey itself.
If the existing installation is not functional or a prior installation did not complete, follow these steps:
 - Backup the files at the path listed above so you can restore your previous installation if needed.
 - Remove the existing installation manually.
 - Rerun this installation script.
 - Reinstall any packages previously installed, if needed (refer to the lib folder in the backup).

Once installation is completed, the backup folder is no longer needed and can be deleted.

# 5 - Install Terraform
 choco install terraform
